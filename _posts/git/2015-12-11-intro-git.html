    	<h5><b>What is GIT??</b></h5>
    	<p>Git is a version control system which is widely used for software development because by using git we can easily do revision of software without wasting bunch of time. Git was originally designed and developed by Linus Torvalds. Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.</p>
    	<h5><b>Why is Git called Git?</b></h5>
    	<p>Linus Torvalds has quipped about the name “git“, which is British English slang for a stupid or unpleasant person: “I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.” (Note that Torvalds did not in fact name Linux.)</p>

         <h5><b>GITHUB</h5></b>
         <p>
         	Github is like social network only difference is that a normal person can’t use github only a coder can. So we can call github as social network of coders and developers. GitHub is a Web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
