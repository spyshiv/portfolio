    <p>Whola !!! If you don't know about d3js you should kill yourself... Just kidding...When i was in second year of my graduation, i have applied for virtual internship in a company through <a href="http://internshala.com/" target="_blank">Internshala</a> and that company was offering 40000-50000 INR. per month and I surprised how? because it was beyond the limit. But when I saw the work that was to build dashboards, analytics UI with d3.js that was my first time to know about d3js. I applied and within a day they gave me a task to complete within a timeline for the further hiring process.</p>
